//! Statically-checked alternatives to [`RefCell`] and [`RwLock`].
//!
//! This crate provides four alternatives to [`RefCell`], each of
//! which checks borrows from the cell at compile-time (statically)
//! instead of checking them at runtime as [`RefCell`] does.  The
//! mechasism for checks is the same for all four.  They only differ
//! in how ownership is represented: [`QCell`] uses an integer ID,
//! [`TCell`] and [`TLCell`] use a marker type, and [`LCell`] uses a
//! Rust lifetime.  Each approach has its advantages and
//! disadvantages.
//!
//! Taking [`QCell`] as an example: [`QCell`] is a cell type where the
//! cell contents are logically 'owned' for borrowing purposes by an
//! instance of an owner type, [`QCellOwner`].  So the cell contents
//! can only be accessed by making borrowing calls on that owner.
//! This behaves similarly to borrowing fields from a structure, or
//! borrowing elements from a `Vec`.  However actually the only link
//! between the objects is that a reference to the owner instance was
//! provided when the cell was created.  Effectively the
//! borrowing-owner and dropping-owner are separated.
//!
//! This enables a pattern where the compiler can statically check
//! mutable access to data stored behind `Rc` references (or other
//! reference types) at compile-time.  This pattern works as follows:
//! The owner is kept on the stack and a mutable reference to it is
//! passed down the stack to calls (for example as part of a context
//! structure).  This is fully checked at compile-time by the borrow
//! checker.  Then this static borrow checking is extended to the cell
//! contents (behind `Rc`s) through using borrowing calls on the owner
//! instance to access the cell contents.  This gives a compile-time
//! guarantee that access to the cell contents is safe.
//!
//! The alternative would be to use [`RefCell`], which panics if two
//! mutable references to the same data are attempted.  With
//! [`RefCell`] there are no warnings or errors to detect the problem
//! at compile-time.  On the other hand, using [`QCell`] the error is
//! detected at compile-time, but the restrictions are much stricter
//! than they really need to be.  For example it's not possible to
//! borrow from more than a few different cells at the same time if
//! they are protected by the same owner, which [`RefCell`] would
//! allow (correctly).  However if you are able to work within these
//! restrictions (e.g. by keeping borrows active only for a short
//! time), then the advantage is that there can never be a panic due
//! to erroneous use of borrowing, because everything is checked by
//! the compiler.
//!
//! Apart from [`QCell`] and [`QCellOwner`], this crate also provides
//! [`TCell`] and [`TCellOwner`] which work the same but use a marker
//! type instead of owner IDs, [`TLCell`] and [`TLCellOwner`] which
//! also use a marker type but which are thread-local, and [`LCell`]
//! and [`LCellOwner`] which use lifetimes.  See the ["Comparison of
//! cell types"](#comparison-of-cell-types) below.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! With [`RefCell`], this compiles but panics:
//!
//! ```should_panic
//!# use std::rc::Rc;
//!# use std::cell::RefCell;
//! let item = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
//! let mut iref = item.borrow_mut();
//! test(&item);
//! iref.push(1);
//!
//! fn test(item: &Rc<RefCell<Vec<u8>>>) {
//!     item.borrow_mut().push(2);    // Panics here
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! With [`QCell`], it refuses to compile:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//!# use qcell::{QCell, QCellOwner};
//!# use std::rc::Rc;
//! let mut owner = QCellOwner::new();
//!
//! let item = Rc::new(QCell::new(&owner, Vec::<u8>::new()));
//! let iref = owner.rw(&item);
//! test(&mut owner, &item);    // Compile error
//! iref.push(1);
//!
//! fn test(owner: &mut QCellOwner, item: &Rc<QCell<Vec<u8>>>) {
//!     owner.rw(&item).push(2);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The solution in both cases is to make sure that the `iref` is not
//! active when the call is made, but [`QCell`] uses standard
//! compile-time borrow-checking to force the bug to be fixed.  This
//! is the main advantage of using these types.
//!
//! Here's a working version using [`TCell`] instead:
//!
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "std",
    doc = "
 ```
# use qcell::{TCell, TCellOwner};
# use std::rc::Rc;
 struct Marker;
 type ACell<T> = TCell<Marker, T>;
 type ACellOwner = TCellOwner<Marker>;
 let mut owner = ACellOwner::new();

 let item = Rc::new(ACell::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
 let iref = owner.rw(&item);
 iref.push(1);
 test(&mut owner, &item);

 fn test(owner: &mut ACellOwner, item: &Rc<ACell<Vec<u8>>>) {
     owner.rw(&item).push(2);
 }
 ```
"
)]
//!
//! And the same thing again using [`LCell`]:
//!
//! ```
//!# use qcell::{LCell, LCellOwner};
//!# use std::rc::Rc;
//! LCellOwner::scope(|mut owner| {
//!     let item = Rc::new(LCell::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
//!     let iref = owner.rw(&item);
//!     iref.push(1);
//!     test(&mut owner, &item);
//! });
//!
//! fn test<'id>(owner: &mut LCellOwner<'id>, item: &Rc<LCell<'id, Vec<u8>>>) {
//!     owner.rw(&item).push(2);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this is safe
//!
//! This is the reasoning behind declaring this crate's interface
//! safe:
//!
//! - Between the cell creation and destruction, the only way to
//! access the contents (for read or write) is through the
//! borrow-owner instance.  So the borrow-owner is the exclusive
//! gatekeeper of this data.
//!
//! - The borrowing calls require a `&` owner reference to return a
//! `&` cell reference, or a `&mut` on the owner to return a `&mut`
//! cell reference.  So this is the same kind of borrow on both sides.
//! The only borrow we allow for the cell is the borrow that Rust
//! allows for the borrow-owner, and while that borrow is active, the
//! borrow-owner and the cell's reference are blocked from further
//! incompatible borrows.  The contents of the cells act as if they
//! were owned by the borrow-owner, just like elements within a `Vec`.
//! So Rust's guarantees are maintained.
//!
//! - The borrow-owner has no control over when the cell's contents
//! are dropped, so the borrow-owner cannot act as a gatekeeper to the
//! data at that point.  However this cannot clash with any active
//! borrow on the data because whilst a borrow is active, the
//! reference to the cell is effectively locked by Rust's borrow
//! checking.  If this is behind an `Rc`, then it's impossible for the
//! last strong reference to be released until that borrow is
//! released.
//!
//! If you can see a flaw in this reasoning or in the code, please
//! raise an issue, preferably with test code which demonstrates the
//! problem.  MIRI in the Rust playground can report on some kinds of
//! unsafety.

//! # Multi-threaded use: Send and Sync
//!
//! Most often the cell-owner will be held by just one thread, and all
//! access to cells will be made within that thread.  However it is
//! still safe to pass or share these objects between threads in some
//! cases, where permitted by the contained type:
//!
//! Cell | Owner type | Cell type
//! ---|---|---
//! `RefCell` | n/a | Send
//! `QCell` | Send + Sync | Send + Sync
//! `TCell` | Send + Sync | Send + Sync
//! `TLCell` |  | Send
//! `LCell` | Send + Sync | Send + Sync
//!
//! I am grateful for contributions from Github users [**Migi**] and
//! [**pythonesque**] to justify the reasoning behind enabling Send
//! and/or Sync.  (`GhostCell` by [**pythonesque**] is a
//! lifetime-based cell that predated `LCell`, but which was only
//! [officially published in
//! 2021](http://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/).  The authors of
//! that paper proved that the logical reasoning behind `GhostCell` is
//! correct, which indirectly strengthens the theoretical
//! justification for other similar cell types, such as the ones in
//! this crate.)
//!
//! Here's an overview of the reasoning:
//!
//! - Unlike `RefCell` these cell types may be `Sync` because mutable
//! access is protected by the cell owner.  You can get mutable access
//! to the cell contents only if you have mutable access to the cell
//! owner.  (Note that `Sync` is only available where the contained
//! type is `Send + Sync`.)
//!
//! - The cell owner may be `Sync` because `Sync` only allows shared
//! immutable access to the cell owner across threads.  So there may
//! exist `&QCell` and `&QCellOwner` references in two threads, but
//! only immutable access to the cell contents is possible like that,
//! so there is no soundness issue.
//!
//! - In general `Send` is safe because that is a complete transfer of
//! some right from one thread to another (assuming the contained type
//! is also `Send`).
//!
//! - `TLCell` is the exception because there can be a different owner
//! with the same marker type in each thread, so owners must not be
//! sent or shared.  Also if two threads have `&TLCell` references to
//! the same cell then mutable references to the contained data could
//! be created in both threads which would break Rust's guarantees.
//! So `TLCell` cannot be `Sync`.  However it can be `Send` because in
//! that case the right to access the data is being transferred
//! completely from one thread to another.
//!
//! # Multi-threaded use: RwLock
//!
//! `QCell` and similar types can also be used as a replacement for
//! `RwLock`.  For example if you have a collection of
//! `Arc<RwLock<T>>`, you can replace them with `Arc<QCell<T>>`.
//! Essentially you're exchanging the fine-grained locking (one for
//! every single `T`) for a coarse-grained lock around the
//! `QCellOwner`.  Depending on the access patterns, this might work
//! out better or worse.  For example if you often need to access
//! several `T` instances in one logical operation, and there is low
//! contention on the big lock, then it will work out better.  Or if
//! you already have `&mut` on the `struct` containing the
//! `QCellOwner`, then you get access to the `T` instances essentially
//! for free.
//!
//! # Origin of names
//!
//! "Q" originally referred to quantum entanglement, the idea being
//! that this is a kind of remote ownership.  "T" refers to it being
//! type system based, "TL" thread-local, "L" to lifetime-based.
