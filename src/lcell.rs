/// thesis from Gankra (formerly

/// [this Reddit

/// and [this Rust playground
/// example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=21a00b0e181a918f8ca4&version=stable).
/// Also see [this Reddit
/// comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3aahl1/outside_of_closures_what_are_some_other_uses_for/csavac5/)
/// and its linked playground code.
///
/// Alternatively, if the **generativity** feature is enabled, the
/// [`generativity`](https://crates.io/crates/generativity) crate can
/// be used to create an owner as follows: `make_guard!(guard); let
/// mut owner = LCellOwner::new(guard);`.  However note that the Rust
/// compiler error messages may be more confusing with
/// **generativity** if you make a mistake and use the wrong owner for
/// a cell.
///
/// Some history: `GhostCell` by
/// [**pythonesque**](https://github.com/pythonesque) predates the
/// creation of `LCell`, and inspired it.  Discussion of `GhostCell`
/// on Reddit showed that a lifetime-based approach to cells was
/// feasible, but unfortunately the `ghost_cell.rs` source didn't seem
/// to be available under a community-friendly licence.  So I went
/// back to first principles and created `LCell` from `TCell` code,
/// combined with invariant lifetime code derived from the various
/// community sources that predate `GhostCell`.  Later `Send` and
/// `Sync` support for `LCell` was contributed independently.
